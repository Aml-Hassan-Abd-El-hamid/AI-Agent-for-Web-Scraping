An AI Agent that does the following:
- takes the main URL that you need to scrape + example of the pages that need to be scraped + example of the output data
- output the data scraped in a csv or a tsv format


Work Plan:
- Set up the manual scraping  process:
    - [ ] code for scraping
    - [ ] pinpoint the data that needs to be fed to the data manually -ex: CSS selectors-
- Automate the process:
    - [ ] Focus on replacing as much as possible of the human input -ex: use an LLM to find the CSS selectors-
- Ship into a simple UI -ex: streamlit-
